# space-invaders

Space Invaders, the 1978 arcade game, is a fixed shooter where you pilot a space ship and are tasked with fending off an alien invasion. The ship you pilot is a 5x5 pixel image with symmetry about the middle column.

This short project was started as a challenge from my brother. He was interested in quickly generating all possible ship configurations, or configurations of a 5x5 array with symmetry about the middle column. As sibling rivalries go, I boasted that I could come up with a faster way to draw all 2^15 = 32768 possible configurations. And thus this project was born.
